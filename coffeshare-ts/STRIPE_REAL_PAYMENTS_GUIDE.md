# 🎉 Real Stripe Payments - See Payments in Dashboard!

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

Your Stripe server is now running! Here's how to see real payments in your Stripe dashboard:

### **1. Server Status ✅**

- **Stripe Server:** Running at `http://localhost:3001`
- **Health Check:** ✅ Working
- **Environment:** Test mode with your keys

### **2. How to Test Real Payments**

1. **Keep the server running** (don't close the terminal)
2. **Open your app** and navigate to Subscriptions
3. **Select a subscription plan**
4. **Use any test card** (the system will detect the server is running)
5. **Complete payment** - it will create a real PaymentIntent
6. **Check your Stripe dashboard** at https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments

### **3. What You'll See in Stripe Dashboard**

When you make a payment, you'll see:

- ✅ **Payment Intent created** with real ID (e.g., `pi_3ABC123...`)
- 💰 **Amount charged** (in cents)
- 🏷️ **Description:** "CoffeeShare Subscription - [Plan Name]"
- 📊 **Status:** Requires payment method / Processing
- 🔧 **Metadata:** Plan ID, User ID, Subscription ID

### **4. Payment Flow Modes**

The app now supports **two modes**:

#### **🔴 Server Offline = Test Mode**

- Shows: "Payment Successful! (Test Mode)"
- No dashboard entries
- Good for quick testing

#### **🟢 Server Online = Real Stripe Mode**

- Shows: "Real Payment Successful!"
- Creates real PaymentIntents
- Appears in Stripe dashboard

### **5. Server Management**

```bash
# Start server
cd server
node stripe-server.js

# Check server status
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# View recent payments
curl http://localhost:3001/payments

# Stop server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
```

**Pro Tip:** Keep the server running in a separate terminal while testing the app. The app automatically detects if the server is online and switches between test/real mode accordingly.
