---

## üîß Performance Monitoring in Production

### Metrics to Monitor

1. **App Launch Time** - Should be faster with optimized bundle
2. **List Scroll Performance** - FlashList provides 50-70% improvement
3. **Memory Usage** - useCallback optimizations reduce memory footprint
4. **Crash Rate** - Better memory management should reduce crashes
5. **User Session Length** - Better UX should increase engagement

### Monitoring Tools

```bash
# Development performance monitoring
import 'utils/wdyr'; // Why Did You Render (development only)

# Production monitoring
# - Firebase Crashlytics (recommended)
# - Firebase Performance Monitoring
# - React Native Performance Monitor
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### Quick Deployment

```bash
# 1. Validate performance
npm run performance-test

# 2. Build production
NODE_ENV=production expo build:ios
NODE_ENV=production expo build:android

# 3. Upload to stores
# (Use your preferred deployment method)
```

### EAS Build (Recommended)

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Build for both platforms
eas build --platform all --profile production
```
